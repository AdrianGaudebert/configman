Getting started
===============

Once you've :ref:`understood what configman is <introduction>`, all you
need to do is to install it::

 $ pip install configman
 
The code is available on github: https://github.com/mozilla/configman
To clone it all you need to do is::

 $ git clone git://github.com/mozilla/configman.git

Once you have it installed, you usually start by importing
``configman`` in your scripts and programs, define the options in
Python and then start exploring how you can :ref:`use config files
<tutorial>` and more advanced :ref:`type conversions <typeconversion>`.
